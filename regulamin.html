                Rules
                1. By making an appointment for the procedure you accept in full the rules and regulations below.

                2. If you want to book an appointment, please contact me through my fanpage on Facebook, or send me an
                e-mail.
                3. When making an appointment for permanent make-up it is required to make an advance payment of £ 50.
                3. Clients should make the advance payment within 3 days of making the appointment. If the payment is
                not
                made, the appointment
                is automatically cancelled and the date booked becomes available for other clients.
                4. If the procedure is carried out, its price will be reduced by the amount of the advance payment.
                5. The advance payment may be made by transfer to my bank account – Monika Stanko 20-43-04 93847896. In
                the
                transfer title please write the date of the procedure and the client’s name and surname.
                6. The client has the right to change the date of the appointment 2 days before the planned appointment
                at the
                latest. If the client cancels the appointment at the last minute, that is on the same day, then, when
                booking
                another visit the client needs to make another advance payment. I recognise, however, extraordinary
                situations
                and random incidents (it must be proved that a given situation occurred).
                7. If the appointment is cancelled later than 2 days in advance, the advance payment is lost.
                8. If the client is more than 30 minutes late for the procedure, it should be rescheduled for a
                different date
                and another advance payment should be made to make a new appointment.
                9. When making an appointment the client should make sure there are no contraindications against the
                procedure. A list of contraindications can be found on my website. If you are not sure as to certain
                contraindications – please write to me. I will be happy to answer your questions.
                10. I recommend that you check the material available on my website before the procedure. You will find
                there,
                among others, a list of potential undesirable effects and recommendations on how to prepare for the
                procedure.
                It is very important that you know what the procedure is about, how
                it is carried out and what effects can be achieved. In case of additionally questions, please send me a
                message.
                11. Clients who have had permanent make-up of their eyebrows done before (even slightly visible) are
                obliged
                to inform me about it and send me
                a current photograph to my e-mail address before making an appointment for the procedure. It is
                sometimes
                required to precede the permanent
                make-up procedure with laser removal.
                12. We will select the method of pigmentation, shape and pigment colour together depending on mutual
                expectations, the client’s skin type and looks. Before the permanent make-up procedure I prepare a
                preliminary
                drawing which allows for visualisation of the final effect.
                13. I reserve the right to refuse to provide the service if the client’s requirements are at variance
                with my
                sense of aesthetics. Photos of my works are available in social media: on my fanpage on Facebook and
                Instagram. Please see before you make an appointment for the procedure.
                14. If the client does not accept the proposed shape, method and colour of pigment, and decides against
                pigmentation during the appointment –
                the advance payment will not be returned.
                15. Supplementary pigmentation which is included in the price of the procedure is performed within 5
                weeks to
                3 months after the first pigmentation.
                16. If the client fails to attend the appointment or cancel it 4 days before the planned procedure,
                another
                correction is paid – the price of such a service is £ 40, paid in advance.
                17. Permanent make-up changes its intensity in the months following the procedure, which is why it is
                recommended to renew it after a year. The price of such a service is 50% of the current price up to 12
                months
                from the first procedure, and up to 18 months it is a cost of 80% of the current price.
                18. If you later decide that you need additional pigmentation to obtain more intense effects, the price
                of
                such a service is £ 40. Additional pigmentation
                is performed 3 months after the last procedure at the latest. The advance payment to be made when
                booking an
                appointment for such a procedure is £ 20.
                19. If you really want to have permanent make-up done in an express mode, the price of such a service is
                30%
                higher.
                20. The procedure requires great concentration on the part of the linergist and the client. For this
                reason,
                when the procedure is underway kids cannot stay
                in the surgery or the lounge.
                21. I reserve the right to change individual points of the rules.

                22. I reserve the right to change the agreed date of the appointment after arranging another date with
                the
                client, convenient for both parties.
