-== new layout based on bootstrap template ==-

So this is second - more defined version of STANKO website, modern design - based on bootstrap template I modified. Overall I tired to pay a lot attention to User experience, having mobile first approach. Code-wise I'm still learning (actually I'm still somewhere on 4th week of my 13 weeks front-end course) but I find it much more interesting and demanding to use existing code and learn more complicated things while I'm learning how to change the template (most of the time it include to go back to the basic and then find solution to particular problem) Although it can be frustrating - its still fun :)

Ideally I would like to use this version of STANKO web site , to create similar - even more refine final version written by me entarily without any frameworks and with proper semantic code using BEM convention:) hopefully I will be able to fulfil this wish in near future.

to my future self --> learn the basic, CSS is fun, JS is not so scary ;P
